					Hey! I‚Äôm Janelle, your English Communication Coach.

				<p>
					As a fellow creative and language learner who values connection,
					community and social change, I understand your ambition to expand your
					project into English and the world. It‚Äôs true what they say‚Ä¶big ideas
					can‚Äôt stay small! And why should English hold you back?
				</p>
				<p>
					I faced the challenge of training to become a facilitator of social
					change in Spanish. Working with new topics, being exposed to new
					vocabulary and working with real clients, I asked myself: ‚ÄòIs my
					Spanish good enough? Can I truly help people?‚Äô. The short answer is,
					‚ÄòYes, it was and yes, I could‚Äô.
				</p>
				<p>
					You see, speaking Spanish was one of my life goals - one that I
					reached in 2016 at age 30! How did I know I‚Äôd made it? Because I felt
					like myself in Spanish. I felt like people were able to see me. Now, I
					want to help you feel that same confidence in English.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since 2019, I‚Äôve been helping Spanish-speaking social entrepreneurs,
					conscious business owners, artists and activists to connect with
					themselves in English so they can confidently engage with the people
					who matter the most - whether at networking events, industry
					gatherings or strategic meetings

					‚ÄúYou never feel 'small' in front of Janelle. It‚Äôs a mix of her love

					them in our daily days. I realise I'm understanding more. I have
					incorporated vocabulary to the meetings and I have courage to speak
					with more fluency".
